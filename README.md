## 💡 What is Applire?

**Applire** is an open-source AI platform that combines deep career intelligence with DACH-specific cultural expertise to automate high-quality CV tailoring.

Built for **all job seekers in the DACH market**, with unmatched depth in regulated industries (Pharma, GxP, Medtech) — a specialization that proves our precision for every user.

Unlike generic CV builders, Applire:
- 🧠 **Learns from you**: Builds a persistent Master Profile that gets smarter with every CV you upload
- 💬 **Interviews you intelligently**: Asks targeted questions to fill gaps between your experience and job requirements
- ✨ **Tailors with precision**: Generates culturally appropriate CVs optimized for DACH recruiters and ATS systems
- 🤖 **Agent-first design**: Accessible to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- 🔒 **Privacy by design**: GDPR-compliant, self-hosted, full data sovereignty

**In 3 simple steps:**
1. 📄 Upload 2-4 versions of your CV
2. 🔗 Paste the job description
3. 💬 Answer a few intelligent questions → ✨ Get a perfectly tailored CV

---

## 👥 Who is Applire for?

Applire serves diverse personas across the DACH job market:

### 💼 **Marcus - The Expert**
Experienced professional with deep domain expertise who needs precision tailoring for demanding roles. Values efficiency and quality over hand-holding.

### 🌍 **Priya - The Relocator**
International candidate moving to DACH who needs cultural "translation" of their career history to meet local CV conventions and recruiter expectations.

### ✏️ **Felix - The Finetuner**
Any user who wants surgical, section-level control over their CV. Trusts AI to draft but wants to fine-tune the output to sound authentic and personal.

### 🤖 **Kaile - The AI Agent**
AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, custom agents) calling Applire on behalf of human users via MCP or REST API for seamless career intelligence integration.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Master Profile

- **Multi-CV Consolidation**: Upload multiple CVs and automatically merge them into a rich, conflict-aware Master Profile
- **Additive Enrichment**: Every CV upload, interview session, and edit enriches your profile — it never overwrites, only accumulates
- **Source Tracking**: Full audit trail of where every piece of information came from
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart detection of factual contradictions (dates, degrees) with user-controlled resolution

### 🎯 Job-First Analysis & Gap Detection

- **Deep JD Analysis**: Extracts requirements, skills, cultural signals, and industry context from job descriptions
- **Transparent Gap Scoring**: 0-100% match score with detailed explanations of what's missing
- **Categorized Gaps**:
  - **Category A** (Hard blockers): Must-have requirements you don't meet
  - **Category B** (Confirmation needed): You likely have this, but it's not stated clearly
  - **Category C** (Exploratory): Soft requirements worth discussing

### 💬 Conversational Interview Orchestrator

- **Two Modes**:
  - **Targeted Mode** (for experienced users): Focuses on filling specific gaps identified in your profile
  - **Guided Mode** (for new users): Systematically builds your profile section by section
- **Stateful Backend**: Pause and resume anytime — your progress is saved server-side
- **Smart Completion**: Automatically detects when you're done or when all gaps are resolved
- **Profile Updates**: Every answer enriches your Master Profile in real-time

### 📄 CV Generation & Fine-Tuning

- **ATS-Optimized PDFs**: Generated via Playwright/Chromium with CSS-based themes
- **Live Browser Preview**: See exactly what your CV will look like before downloading
- **Section-Level Editing**: Fine-tune individual sections (introduction, positions, skills) with live re-rendering
- **Dual Save Path**: Save edits to your Master Profile (permanent) or just to this CV (one-time)
- **AI-Assisted Editing**: Optional "Let Kaile help" for targeted gap completion within the editor
- **Cover Letter Generation**: AI-powered cover letter creation based on JD and Master Profile
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Automatic detection and formatting for German, Austrian, and Swiss CV conventions

### 🗺️ DACH Cultural Intelligence

- **Market-Specific Formatting**: Lebenslauf vs. international CV formats
- **Cultural Signal Detection**: Identifies when a CV needs adaptation (e.g., Indian → German pharma standards)
- **Multilingual Support**: German and English UI; French and Spanish planned
- **Regulatory Industry Depth**: Specialized knowledge for Pharma, GxP, Medtech roles

### 🔒 Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- **Privacy by Design** (GDPR Art. 25): Minimal data collection, encryption at rest
- **Automated Retention**: Daily cron job enforces TTLs:
  - Uploaded files: 7 days
  - Interview sessions: 30 days
  - Generated CVs: 90 days (human) / 24 hours (agent)
- **Right to Erasure** (GDPR Art. 17): One-click full data deletion
- **Self-Hosted**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure

---

## 🤖 Built for the AI Agent Era

Applire is the first career platform optimized for **AI agents as customers**:

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Seamless Integration**: First-class support for Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, and custom AI agents
- **Stateful Sessions**: Agents can pause, resume, and recover from interruptions
- **Flow Orchestrator**: Guides agents through the correct sequence (JD analysis → CV import → gap analysis → interview → generation)
- **Async Generation**: Non-blocking CV generation with polling-based status checks

### REST API
- **Full HTTP API**: Programmatic access for remote integrations
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive Swagger UI at `/docs`

### Agent Workflow Example
```bash
# Start MCP server (stdio transport)
python -m applire.mcp

# Agent calls:
1. start_flow() → flow_id
2. analyze_jd(text="Senior Python Engineer...") → job_id
3. analyze_gaps(job_id) → gap_report
4. run_interview(session_id, message="I have 5 years...") → next_question
5. generate_cv(job_id) → cv_id (async)
6. get_cv_status(cv_id) → {status: "ready", pdf_url: "..."}
```
