   - **Professional Summary**: 2-3 sentences
   - **Work Experience**: 2-3 positions with dates and achievements
   - **Education**: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field
   - **Skills**: Programming languages (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript), frameworks, tools
3. Export/Save as PDF: `sample_cv.pdf`
4. Place the file in `Solution/tests/fixtures/profiles/sample_cv.pdf`
5. Commit to Git

## Option 2: Generate Programmatically

If you prefer to generate the PDF programmatically (e.g., using reportlab in Python), create a script:

```python
# generate_sample_cv.py
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet, ParagraphStyle
from reportlab.lib.units import inch
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak
from reportlab.lib.enums import TA_LEFT, TA_CENTER

# Create PDF
pdf_file = "Solution/tests/fixtures/profiles/sample_cv.pdf"
doc = SimpleDocTemplate(pdf_file, pagesize=letter, topMargin=0.5*inch, bottomMargin=0.5*inch)

# Define styles
styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
title_style = ParagraphStyle(name='Title', parent=styles['Heading1'], fontSize=14, textColor='black', alignment=TA_CENTER, spaceAfter=6)
heading_style = ParagraphStyle(name='Heading', parent=styles['Heading2'], fontSize=11, textColor='black', spaceAfter=6)
body_style = ParagraphStyle(name='Body', parent=styles['BodyText'], fontSize=10, spaceAfter=3)

# Build content
content = [
    Paragraph("MARCUS CHEN", title_style),
    Paragraph("marcus.chen@example.com | +49 6131 123456 | Mainz, Germany", body_style),
    Spacer(1, 0.2*inch),
    Paragraph("PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY", heading_style),
    Paragraph("Experienced software engineer with 6+ years developing full-stack applications.", body_style),
    # ... Add more content ...
]

# Build PDF
doc.build(content)
print(f"✓ CV generated: {pdf_file}")
```

Then run: `python generate_sample_cv.py`
