# Contributing to Applire

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Applire! This document explains how to get involved.

## Contributor License Agreement

By submitting a pull request you agree to the [Applire Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md).

This grants Applire the right to distribute your contribution under the AGPL-3.0 (Community Edition) and, if applicable, under a commercial license (Cloud Edition). You retain copyright in your contribution.

> **Note:** CLA signature via [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io) will be required before your first PR is merged (coming soon).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- A clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Version / environment info (OS, Python version, Docker version)

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue with the label `enhancement`. Describe the use case and why it matters for DACH job seekers or self-hosters.

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. **Set up** the development environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.dev.example .env.dev   # fill in your values
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. **Write tests** for any new functionality (coverage gate: ≥75%)
4. **Run the test suite** before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   # Backend unit tests
   pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=applire --cov-fail-under=75

   # Frontend unit tests
   cd frontend && npm test

   # E2E tests (requires running stack)
   npx playwright test
   ```
5. **Follow commit conventions**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`
6. **Open a pull request** against `main` — CI must pass before review

### Architecture Changes

Changes that affect the open-core boundary (`applire` vs `applire.cloud`), data retention, or GDPR scope require an ADR. Add your ADR to `Documents/Architecture/ADR.md` and reference it in `arc42.md`. Open a discussion issue first.

## Code Style

- **Python**: Black formatting, type annotations on all new functions
- **TypeScript**: strict mode, no `any`
- **Database**: all schema changes via Alembic migrations — never raw DDL
- **MCP tools**: always async, short-lived `AsyncSession` per tool call

## Development Guidelines

- `applire.cloud.*` is cloud-only — never import it from `applire.*` directly; use the `HAS_CLOUD` guard in `config.py`
- Do not add `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars that reference cloud infrastructure
- 100% EU data residency — do not add US-based sub-processors

## Getting Help

- Open a GitHub issue tagged `question`
- Check existing issues and the `docs/` directory first
