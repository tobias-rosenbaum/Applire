"""Mistral Vision OCR backend — Community Edition default (ADR 014).

Uses pixtral-12b directly via the mistralai SDK.
The CVImageExtractor abstraction is vendor-independent; this implementation
calls the Mistral SDK directly because vision calls require a different model
and multimodal message format that the LLMProvider interface (ADR 009) does not
expose — that interface is intentionally minimal for text completion.
