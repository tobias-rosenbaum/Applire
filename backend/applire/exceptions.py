"""Application-wide exception hierarchy.

LLM errors are raised by provider implementations and caught by routers.
Providers translate vendor-specific errors (openai.RateLimitError, httpx 429, etc.)
into these unified types so routers never import SDK-specific exceptions.
"""

    Retry strategy: 3 attempts, exponential backoff starting at 2s (tenacity).
    Routers should surface this as HTTP 503 with Retry-After guidance.
