"""LLM Review Layer — reviewer-guided retry loop (ADR-021, Sprint 20).

review_and_refine() runs a reviewer LLM call after the initial generator output.
If the reviewer rejects the draft it feeds the critique back to the generator
and retries, up to max_retries times.

Never raises — on retry exhaustion the last draft is returned and a WARNING
is logged so the issue is observable without breaking the caller's flow.

    Source text is passed to the reviewer only. The generator's retry call
    receives the previous draft and the reviewer's feedback — no raw source.
    If the reviewer's fix requires content not present in the draft, the
    reviewer is expected to quote the relevant source passages in `feedback`.

    Args:
        source: The original source material the reviewer checks the draft against.
        draft: The initial generator output to be reviewed.
        generator_prompt_fn: Called as fn(previous_draft, feedback) -> str.
        generator_system: The refinement-mode system prompt (NOT the extraction prompt).
        reviewer_prompt_fn: Called as fn(source, draft) -> str.
        reviewer_system: The reviewer's system prompt.
        provider: LLM provider — same instance used by the calling service.
        max_retries: Maximum number of generator retries. 0 = review layer disabled.
        generator_max_tokens: Token budget for the generator retry calls.
        chain_id: Identifier for the calling chain (cv_extraction, profile_extraction,
                  cv_tailoring, interview_response). Used for log dimensionality.

    Returns:
        The approved draft, or the last generated draft if retries are exhausted.
