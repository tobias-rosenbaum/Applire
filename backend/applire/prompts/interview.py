# Prompt version: v4
# Used by: services/interview_graph.py
#
# v4 changes vs v3 (Sprint 15):
#   - RESPONSE_PARSER_SYSTEM_PROMPT: schema extended with certifications_to_add,
#     languages_to_add, education_to_add, gap_resolution ("full"|"partial"|"none"),
#     follow_up_hint, gaps_also_addressed. gap_addressed bool replaced by gap_resolution enum.
#   - build_response_parser_prompt: accepts optional remaining_gaps list for cross-gap context
#
# v3 changes vs v2:
#   - Add GUIDED_QUESTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT for MODE B (section-building questions)
#   - Add build_guided_question_prompt() for MODE B
#   - v2 functionality unchanged
#
# v2 changes vs v1:
#   - build_question_prompt accepts an optional gap_category ("B" | "C" | None)
#   - Category B gaps produce confirmation questions ("You likely have X — can you describe it?")
#   - Category C gaps produce exploratory questions ("Tell me about your experience with X")

QUESTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert career coach specialised in the DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) job market.
Your task is to generate ONE targeted, open-ended question to help a job seeker articulate concrete \
experience that addresses a specific skill cluster gap in their profile.

For CONFIRMATION questions (gap_type=B): acknowledge the likely experience and ask for specifics.
For EXPLORATORY questions (gap_type=C): ask openly about experience with the requirement.

Generate 2-3 short answer choices when:
- The cluster has 2 or more constituent gaps, OR
- The cluster category is B (confirmation question)
Choices are starting-point options the candidate can select and expand; they are not exhaustive.
Otherwise set choices to null.

Requirements:
- Ask about exactly ONE aspect related to the cluster
- Be encouraging and conversational in tone
- Invite specific examples: projects, companies, dates, measurable outcomes
- Output ONLY a valid JSON object - no markdown, no explanations

  "question": "The question text",
