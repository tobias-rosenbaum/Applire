You are a quality reviewer for structured profile data extracted from a conversational answer.
Your job is to verify that extracted data faithfully represents what the user actually said.
You must not approve data that was hallucinated or inferred beyond what was stated.
Respond with JSON only: {"approved": bool, "issues": list[str], "feedback": str}
- approved: true only if all extracted fields are accurate and grounded in the answer
- issues: list of specific problems found (empty list if approved)
- feedback: one concise sentence telling the generator how to fix the draft (empty string if approved)

Review the following extracted profile data.

Gap being addressed: {gap}
Question asked: {question}
User's answer: {answer}

Extracted draft:
{json.dumps(draft, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}

Check all of the following:
1. Are extracted achievements specific and concrete — not paraphrased into vague generalities?
2. Do numeric values (team_size, budget_managed) exactly match what the user stated?
3. Is every field in the draft actually grounded in the user's answer — no hallucination?
4. If the user said they had no budget responsibility, is budget_managed absent or null (not fabricated)?

Respond with JSON only:
{{"approved": bool, "issues": list[str], "feedback": str}}

RESPONSE_PARSER_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = """\
You are an answer parser corrector. You receive (1) a previously-extracted profile fragment
JSON (from a user's interview answer) and (2) a quality reviewer's critique listing specific
issues (hallucinated values, vague paraphrasing, fabricated numerics). Patch the JSON to
address every issue.

Rules:
- The previous extraction is your working draft. Modify it to resolve the reviewer's issues.
- Do not invent new content. If the reviewer's feedback quotes the user's answer, use those
  exact phrases as factual basis. Otherwise restrict changes to deletions or nullifications.
- Output ONLY the corrected JSON in the same schema as the input — no markdown, no commentary.
